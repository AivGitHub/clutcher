# Clutcher
Project to work with data in the Internet.\
It will be a Torrent client and the Internet Browser (later).

## Installation
```pip install clutcher```

## Information
- It is a Pre-alpha version.
- GUI development started. I use PyQt5.
- IDE for generating code is/will NOT be included in this project.
- Now you can run GUI with -g, --gui option
- Now you can use -db or --database option to save progress in database
- I decided to use sqlite3, because it is simple and doesn't use any libs
- I didn't want to use SQLAlchemy or any other lib,
because this requires installation of an additional packages.
- Option -d, --detach does not work yet
- I haven't added to PyPI yet

**Steps**:

2. Torrent GUI client.
3. Web browser.
